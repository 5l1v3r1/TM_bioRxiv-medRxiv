Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control.

In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions.

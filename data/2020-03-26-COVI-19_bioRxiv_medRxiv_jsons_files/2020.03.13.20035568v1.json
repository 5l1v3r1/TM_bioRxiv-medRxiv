The median estimate by participants for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with Covid-19 was 4.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 10.0%). Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of Covid-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 33.8% (95% CI: 32.6% - 35.0%) of participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was \"highly effective\" in protecting them from acquiring Covid-19. 27.6% (95% CI: 26.5% - 28.7%) of participants thought it prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. In addition, 29.7% (95% CI: 28.1% - 31.3%) of US participants and 40.7% (95% CI: 39.0% - 42.5%) of UK participants stated that if they were an Uber driver, they would at least sometimes refuse rides to passengers with East Asian-sounding names to reduce their risk of infection. 46.6% (95% CI: 45.3% - 47.8%) of participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death from Covid-19.\nLimitation: While participants were representative of the UK and US adult population by age, sex, ethnicity, household income, and education, they may not be representative by other (unobserved) characteristics.  \nConclusion: These findings can guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media.

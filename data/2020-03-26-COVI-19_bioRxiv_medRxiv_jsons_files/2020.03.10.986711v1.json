Without effective therapeutics or vaccines being available, effective hygiene measure are of utmost importance to prevent viral spreading. It is therefore crucial to evaluate current infection control strategies against SARS-CoV-2. We show the inactivation of the novel coronavirus for the first time and endorse the importance of disinfectant-based hand hygiene to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.", "full_text_html_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.986711v1.full", "public_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.986711v1", "abstract_html_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.986711v1.abstract", "pdf_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/17/2020.03.10.986711.full.pdf", "rights": "\u00a9 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

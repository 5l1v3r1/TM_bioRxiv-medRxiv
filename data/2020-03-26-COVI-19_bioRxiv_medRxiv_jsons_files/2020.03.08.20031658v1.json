Compared with mild patients (n\u2009=\u200944), severe or critical patients (n\u2009=\u200925) were significantly older (median age, 67 years [IQR, 58-79] vs. 49 years [IQR, 36-60]; P\u2009&lt;\u20090.01). Fever was present in 98.6% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (62.3%), fatigue (58.0%), sputum (39.1%), and headache (33.3%).

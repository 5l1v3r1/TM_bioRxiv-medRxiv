Multivariable logistic regression revealed that AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. \nConclusion. Older age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients.

After the first patient was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, this infecting disease broke out quickly, spread around all over the world and was persistently evolving so far. Until 6 March, 2020, 80581 cases were confirmed to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 3016 cases died from SARS-CoV-2 infection in China. In other countries, total 17024 COVID-19 patients were confirmed and 343 patients died after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. This novel disease is a neo-type respiratory contagious disease that has high infectivity and mortality as well as heavy damage on public health. Clinical trial has been registered before this research. However, it needs a long time to finish all the process, the clinical trial ID is not obtained temporarily and still transacted. \n\n### Funding Statement\n\nThis study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81630084) and National Natural Science Foundation Incubation Program of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (2019GQFY06).\n\n### Author Declarations\n\nAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.\n\nYes\n\nAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.\n\nYes\n\nI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).\n\nYes\n\nI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.\n\nYes\n\nWe declare that all data referred to in the manuscript is availability.", "full_text_html_url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035329v1.full", "public_url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035329v1", "abstract_html_url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035329v1.abstract", "pdf_url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/03/16/2020.03.13.20035329.full.pdf", "rights": "\u00a9 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

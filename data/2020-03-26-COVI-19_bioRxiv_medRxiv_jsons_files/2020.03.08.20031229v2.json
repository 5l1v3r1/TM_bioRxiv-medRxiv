Based on the reference ranges of normal Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19 infection are CD3+ lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm3, CD4+ lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm3, and CD8+ lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm3.</p>", "twitter_description": "In December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China.

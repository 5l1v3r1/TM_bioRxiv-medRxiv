Currently, there is no such in-depth information on protein structure and function available in public domain and no effective anti-viral or vaccines are available for the treatment of this infection. Our study provides comparative order and disorder-based proteome information with Human SARS and Bat CoV that may be useful for structure-based drug discovery.\n\n*   List of Abbreviations\n    :   \n    ACE2\n    :   Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\n    CDF\n    :   Cumulative distribution function\n    CH\n    :   Charge hydropathy\n    COVID-19\n    :   Coronavirus disease 2019\n    CTD\n    :   C-terminal domain\n    DMVs\n    :   Double-membrane vesicles\n    ICTV\n    :   International committee on taxonomy of viruses\n    IDP\n    :   Intrinsically disordered proteins\n    IDPRs\n    :   Intrinsically disordered protein regions\n    IFN\n    :   Interferon\n    MSA\n    :   Multiple sequence alignment\n    Nsps\n    :   Non-structural proteins\n    NTD\n    :   N-terminal domain\n    PONDR\n    :   Predictor of natural disordered regions\n    PPID\n    :   Predicted percentage of intrinsic disorder\n    RBD\n    :   Receptor binding domain\n    SARS\n    :   Severe acute respiratory syndrome\n    TRS\n    :   Transcriptional regulatory sequences\n    VLPs\n    :   Virus-like particles\n    WHO\n    :   World health organization", "full_text_html_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990598v1.full", "public_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990598v1", "abstract_html_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990598v1.abstract", "pdf_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/14/2020.03.13.990598.full.pdf", "rights": "\u00a9 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

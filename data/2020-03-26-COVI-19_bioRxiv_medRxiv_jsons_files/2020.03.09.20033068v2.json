The blood type distribution was significantly different, with type A 44.44%, type B 29.29%, type AB 8.08% and type O 18.19%.The clinical manifestations of new coronavirus pneumonia are non-specific,the common symptom was fever (91 [90.10%] of 101 patients),Cough (69[68.32%]) and dyspnea (75[74.26%]). Neutrophils, PCT, CRP,IL-6,D-dimer gradually increased as time went on.Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission,with the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased.61(60.40%) used antiviral drugs,59(58.42%) used glucocorticoids, 63.37% used intravenous immunoglobulins, and 44.55% used thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, 63(62.38%) used restricted antibiotics, 23(22.78%) used antifungal drugs.84(83.17%) used non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy equipment, and 76.24% used invasive mechanical ventilation. 7 patients were treated with ECMO and 8 patients were treated with CRRT.The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00 days(IQR 0.00-6.00).

Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of \u22652 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%).  The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age&gt;70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with \u22653 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of  80% in the UK population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as  110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. \n\nInterpretation: We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages.

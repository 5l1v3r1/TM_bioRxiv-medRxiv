We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT).

We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car.

The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature \u226537.3C was 36.2C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity.\nConclusions: Wrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance.

Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package \u2018MyCoV\u2019 which classifies user generated sequences.", "full_text_html_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.974311v1.full", "public_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.974311v1", "abstract_html_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.974311v1.abstract", "pdf_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/06/2020.03.02.974311.full.pdf", "rights": "\u00a9 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

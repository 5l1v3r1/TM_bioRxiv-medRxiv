Methods:Chest CT scans and Clinical data of 21 patients confirmed NCP in our hospital were enrolled.These patients were divided into mild and sever group according to clinical manifestations described by the 6th clinical practice guideline of NCP in China. Main clinical and chest CT features were analyzed and identify. Results: Fever (85.7%) and cough (80.9%) were the two main symptoms of NCP patients.More significantly higher incidence (85.7%) of shortness of breath in the severe cases. Multiple lesions in both lungs and with incidence of GGO(100%),vascular enlargement (76.5%) and cobblestone/reticular pattern(70.6%) were the major feature.The incidence of consolidation, mixed pattern and vascular enlargement features were up to 100% in the severe group, significantly higher than that of patients in mild group. In addition, the incidence of air-bronchogram, dilated bronchi with thickened wall and fibrosis in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the mild group.

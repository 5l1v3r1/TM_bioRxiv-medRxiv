It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease.

The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 \u2212 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 \u2212 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 \u2212 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 \u2212 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 \u2212 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 \u2212 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity.\n\n<b>Conclusions</b>\nDyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness.

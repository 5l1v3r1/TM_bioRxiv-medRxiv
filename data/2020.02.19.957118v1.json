With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. In addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.", "full_text_html_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.957118v1.full", "public_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.957118v1", "abstract_html_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.957118v1.abstract", "pdf_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/20/2020.02.19.957118.full.pdf", "rights": "\u00a9 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

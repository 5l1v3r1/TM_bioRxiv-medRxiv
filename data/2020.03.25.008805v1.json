These hotlines face a deluge of callers which far exceeds their capabilities, thus leading to waiting times of hours or, in many cases, a complete inability to get into contact with health authorities. Methods: Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 different diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 both with regards to a diverse set of clinical cases and diseases similar in presentation to COVID-19. Findings: We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 from diseases with similar symptoms in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three symptoms. Lastly, we showed that Symptoma9s accuracy exceeds that of simple 99yes-no99 questionnaires widely available online. Interpretation: Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while concurrently considering over 20,000 other diseases. Furthermore, Symptoma offers predefined questions alongside free text input in 36 languages. This makes Symptoma a key tool in taking pressure off from health authorities worldwide. The Symptoma predictor is freely available as a web application at https://www.symptoma.com/.</p>", "twitter_description": "Background: As the pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses worldwide, many governments have established phone hotlines to pre-screen potential COVID-19 cases.
